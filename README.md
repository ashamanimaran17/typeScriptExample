# react-projects-5-menu

The base code for this project is taken from a react tutorial(nothing to do with typescript) source code for react project in github 
https://github.com/john-smilga/react-projects/tree/master/05-menu

- added typescript to the project and changed the file names to tsx to have it compiled by typescript

added comments to the typescript files in places where typescript is added for easy checking with //typescript-example
